RGB is confidential & scalable client-validated smart contracts for Bitcoin &
Lightning. To learn more about RGB please check [RGB website][Site].

RGB Consensus library provides consensus-critical and validation code for RGB.

The consensus-critical code library is shared with the following libraries:
1. [Client-side-validation Lib][Foundation]. It is
   non-bitcoin-specific library, covering concepts related to
   client-side-validation (commitments, single-use-seals abstracted from
   bitcoin, consensus-critical data encoding protocols).
2. [BP Core Lib][BP]. This is client-side-validation applied to bitcoin protocol
   with deterministic bitcoin commitments (tapret) and TXO-based
   single-use-seals.
3. [AluVM virtual machine][AluVM] used by RGB for Turing-complete smart contract
   functionality.
4. [Strict types][StrictTypes], defining memory layout and serialization of
   structured data types used in RGB smart contracts.
